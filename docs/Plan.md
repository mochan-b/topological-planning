## Tasks to be Done

### Python Implementation

- Make a small graph that shows the overhead map. 
  - Show the ego position
  - Show the goal region
- Extend the graph into multiple graphs that shows the map view and then also the 3d $(t,x,y)$ view

### Literature Survey

- How far did Sibhrajit take the Homotopy class reasons
  - String based representation of homotopies
  - https://www.lehigh.edu/~sub216/publications <- more literature survey
- Brief summaries of the papers that have been made so far and what they are trying to do here

### Writing

- Write up the definitions of trajectory homotopies
- What is the difference between homology and homotopy and why do we care for one over the other. What does one offer the other does not.
